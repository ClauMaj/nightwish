        "summary" : "This album marked a definitive change in musical scope for Nightwish from their folk-laden roots in Angels Fall First, showcasing a more bombastic, power metal-oriented sound with faster tempos, harmonic guitar/keyboard leads, and plenty of double-bass-heavy drumwork. During that time, Stratovarius was Holopainen's biggest inspiration, hence the power metal sound of the album. Oceanborn's sound hearkens a more dramatic approach in the overall musical scope, mostly relegated to the symphonic keyboard work and lead singer Tarja Turunen's vocals.",

        "summary" : "Wishmaster's sound continues the bombastic symphonic power metal approach originally featured on Oceanborn, albeit with more emphasis on atmosphere and melody versus speed and heaviness. Perhaps even more so than its predecessor, Wishmaster has a very clear fantasy theme. While commonly considered to be closer to conventional power metal, there is still a great variety with slower songs like \"Two for Tragedy\" and \"Dead Boy's Poem\", and more epic pieces like \"FantasMic\". \"The Kinslaye\" is written about the victims of the Columbine High School massacre. \"Wishmaster\" was inspired by the fantasy novel series The Lord of the Rings and Dragonlance, mentioning Elbereth, LÃ³rien, and the Grey Havens from the former; and Dalamar, Raistlin Majere (Dalamar's shalafi, or \"master\"), Gilthanas, the Sla-Mori, Silvara and the Inn of the Last Home from the latter.\"FantasMic\" is a song about the Disney animated movies, particularly their fantasy and fable elements, taking its title from the Disneyland show Fantasmic.",
